The testbench simulated, but had errors. Please fix the module. The output of iverilog is as follows:
VCD info: dumpfile wave.vcd opened for output.
Hint: Your circuit passed when given only one-hot inputs, but not with random inputs.
Hint: Are you doing something more complicated than deriving state transition equations by inspection?

./Execute_environment/testbench.sv:39: $finish called at 3001 (1ps)
Hint: Output 'next_state' has 284 mismatches. First mismatch occurred at time 1010.
Hint: Output 'out' has 186 mismatches. First mismatch occurred at time 1010.
Hint: Total mismatched samples is 284 out of 600 samples
