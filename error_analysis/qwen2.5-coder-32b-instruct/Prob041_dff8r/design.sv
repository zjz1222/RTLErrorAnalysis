Status: Error running testbench

Fail Messages:The testbench simulated, but had errors. Please fix the module. The output of iverilog is as follows:
VCD info: dumpfile wave.vcd opened for output.
Hint: Your reset should be synchronous, but doesn't appear to be.
./execute_environment/testbench.sv:65: $finish called at 2161 (1ps)
Hint: Output 'q' has 41 mismatches. First mismatch occurred at time 55.
Hint: Total mismatched samples is 41 out of 432 samples

Simulation finished at 2161 ps
Mismatches: 41 in 432 samples
