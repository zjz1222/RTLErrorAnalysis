Status: Error running testbench

Fail Messages:The testbench simulated, but had errors. Please fix the module. The output of iverilog is as follows:
VCD info: dumpfile wave.vcd opened for output.
Hint: Your reset should be synchronous, but doesn't appear to be.

Hint: Output 'q' has 185 mismatches. First mismatch occurred at time 65.
Hint: Total mismatched samples is 185 out of 421 samples

Simulation finished at 2106 ps
Mismatches: 185 in 421 samples
