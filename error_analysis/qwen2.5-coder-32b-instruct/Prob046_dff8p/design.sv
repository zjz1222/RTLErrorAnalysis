Status: Error running testbench

Fail Messages:The testbench simulated, but had errors. Please fix the module. The output of iverilog is as follows:
VCD info: dumpfile wave.vcd opened for output.
Hint: Your reset should be synchronous, but doesn't appear to be.

Hint: Output 'q' has 46 mismatches. First mismatch occurred at time 75.
Hint: Total mismatched samples is 46 out of 436 samples

Simulation finished at 2181 ps
Mismatches: 46 in 436 samples
