A linear feedback shift register is a shift register usually with a few
XOR gates to produce the next state of the shift register. A Galois LFSR
is one particular arrangement that shifts right, where a bit position with
a "tap" is XORed with the LSB output bit (q[0]) to produce its next value,
while bit positions without a tap shift right unchanged.  Build a 32-bit Galois
LFSR with taps at bit positions 32, 22, 2, and 1. Reset should be active high
synchronous, and should reset the output q to 32'h1.
