[Keyword]: Edgedetect

[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
The circuit detects positive edges on each bit of an 8-bit input signal. It outputs a corresponding 8-bit signal where each bit indicates whether a positive edge (a transition from 0 to 1) has occurred on the respective input bit.

[Input Signal Description]:
- clk: Clock signal used to synchronize the detection of positive edges.
- in[7:0]: 8-bit input signal on which positive edge detection is performed.

[Output Signal Description]:
- pedge[7:0]: 8-bit output signal where each bit is set to 1 if a positive edge is detected on the corresponding input bit, otherwise it is set to 0.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    output [7:0] pedge
);
    integer i;
    reg [7:0] intmp;
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        for(i = 0; i < 8; i = i + 1) begin
            if(intmp[i] != in[i] && in[i] == 1) begin
                pedge[i] = 1;
            end
            else begin
                pedge[i] = 0;
            end
            intmp[i] = in[i];
        end
    end
