[Keyword]: Modulename

[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
The module 'topmodule' instantiates another module 'moda' which takes four input signals and produces two output signals. The specific function of 'moda' is not provided, but it likely performs a combinational logic operation based on the inputs.

[Input Signal Description]:
a, b, c, d: These are individual input signals to the 'topmodule', which are passed to the 'moda' instance. The specific role of each input depends on the internal logic of 'moda'.

[Output Signal Description]:
out1, out2: These are the output signals from the 'moda' instance, which are also the outputs of the 'topmodule'. Their values depend on the logic implemented within 'moda'.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule ( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    input c,
    input d,
    output out1,
    output out2
);
    moda instance1(.in1(a), .in2(b), .in3(c), .in4(d), .out1(out1), .out2(out2),);
endmodule
