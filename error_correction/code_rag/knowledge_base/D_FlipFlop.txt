[Keyword]: D_FlipFlop

[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design is a D Flip-Flop with an asynchronous clear. It captures the value of the input D on the rising edge of the clock signal (clk) and outputs it on O. If the clear signal is asserted (active low), the output O is reset to 0 regardless of the clock.

[Input Signal Description]:
- D: Data input signal. The value of D is captured on the rising edge of the clock if the clear signal is not active.
- clk: Clock input signal. The rising edge of this signal triggers the capturing of the D input.
- clear: Asynchronous clear input signal. When this signal is low, it resets the output O to 0 immediately, regardless of the clock.

[Output Signal Description]:
- O: Output signal. It holds the value of the D input captured on the rising edge of the clock, unless the clear signal is active, in which case it is reset to 0.
