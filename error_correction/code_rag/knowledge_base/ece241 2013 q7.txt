[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a JK flip-flop, a type of sequential logic circuit that changes its output state based on the inputs J and K and the clock signal. The JK flip-flop is a versatile memory element used in various digital systems.

[Input Signal Description]:
- clk: Clock signal that triggers the state change on its rising edge.
- j: J input, used to control the set/reset behavior of the flip-flop.
- k: K input, used to control the toggle/reset behavior of the flip-flop.

[Output Signal Description]:
- Q: The output of the JK flip-flop, which holds the current state of the flip-flop.

[Design Detail]: 
```verilog
module topmodule (
    input clk,
    input j,
    input k,
    output reg Q
); 
    
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (!j) begin
            Q <= k ? j : Q;
        end
        else begin
            Q <= k ? ~Q : j;
        end
    end

endmodule
