[Keyword]: Tbclock

[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design generates a clock signal with a specified time period. The clock signal toggles its state every half of the time period, effectively creating a square wave. This clock signal is then used to drive a device under test (DUT).

[Input Signal Description]:
There are no external input signals in this module. The clock signal is internally generated.

[Output Signal Description]:
There are no direct output signals from this module. However, the generated clock signal is used as an input to the DUT instance.

[Design Detail]: 
```verilog
module topmodule ( );
    parameter timeperiod = 10;
    reg clock;
    initial begin
        clock = 0;
    end
    always begin
        #(timeperiod / 2) clock = ~clock;
    end
    dut dut1(clock);
endmodule
