[Keyword]: pulp_sync.sv

[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]: 
The design is a multi-stage synchronizer used to safely transfer a serial input signal across clock domains. It consists of a series of flip-flops (determined by the parameter STAGES) that help mitigate metastability issues by synchronizing the input signal to the clock domain of the output.

[Input Signal Description]:
- clk_i: Clock input signal used to synchronize the flip-flops.
- rstn_i: Active-low reset signal that initializes the flip-flops to zero.
- serial_i: Serial input signal that is to be synchronized to the clock domain of the output.

[Output Signal Description]:
- serial_o: Synchronized output signal that is the result of the input signal passing through the series of flip-flops.
