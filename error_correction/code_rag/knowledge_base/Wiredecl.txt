[Keyword]: Wiredecl

[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a simple combinational logic circuit that performs a series of logical operations on its inputs. It computes the logical AND of two pairs of inputs and then performs a logical OR on the results. Additionally, it provides both the direct output and its logical negation.

[Input Signal Description]:
- a: A single-bit input signal.
- b: A single-bit input signal.
- c: A single-bit input signal.
- d: A single-bit input signal.

[Output Signal Description]:
- out: The output signal representing the logical OR of the AND results of the input pairs (a & b) and (c & d).
- outn: The output signal representing the logical negation of the 'out' signal.

```verilog
`defaultnettype none
module topmodule(
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    input d,
    output out,
    output outn   ); 
    
    wire wire1, wire2, wire3;
    assign wire1 = a & b;
    assign wire2 = c & d;
    assign wire3 = wire1 | wire2;
    assign out = wire3;
    assign outn = ~wire3;
    
endmodule
