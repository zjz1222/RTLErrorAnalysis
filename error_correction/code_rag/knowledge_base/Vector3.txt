[Keyword]: Vector3

[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design concatenates six 5-bit input signals and a 2-bit constant to form four 8-bit output signals. The concatenation is done in such a way that the total number of bits is 32, which is then divided into four 8-bit outputs.

[Input Signal Description]:
- a[4:0]: 5-bit input signal
- b[4:0]: 5-bit input signal
- c[4:0]: 5-bit input signal
- d[4:0]: 5-bit input signal
- e[4:0]: 5-bit input signal
- f[4:0]: 5-bit input signal

[Output Signal Description]:
- w[7:0]: 8-bit output signal, part of the concatenated result
- x[7:0]: 8-bit output signal, part of the concatenated result
- y[7:0]: 8-bit output signal, part of the concatenated result
- z[7:0]: 8-bit output signal, part of the concatenated result

[Design Detail]: 
module top_module (
    input [4:0] a, b, c, d, e, f,
    output [7:0] w, x, y, z
);
    assign {w, x, y, z} = {a, b, c, d, e, f, 2'b11};
endmodule
