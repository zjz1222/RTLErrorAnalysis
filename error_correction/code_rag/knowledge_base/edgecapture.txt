[Keyword]: edgecapture

[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design detects the falling edges of a 32-bit input signal. It stores the result of the detected falling edges in a 32-bit output register. A falling edge is detected when a bit changes from 1 to 0.

[Input Signal Description]:
- clk: Clock signal that triggers the sequential logic on its rising edge.
- reset: Active-high reset signal that initializes the output to zero.
- in[31:0]: 32-bit input signal that is processed and stored on each clock cycle.

[Output Signal Description]:
- out[31:0]: 32-bit output signal that is updated based on the bitwise operation involving the current and previous input values.

[Design Detail]: 
```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input reset,
  input [31:0] in,
  output reg [31:0] out
);

  reg [31:0] d_last;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    d_last <= in;
    if (reset)
      out <= '0;
    else
      out <= out | (~in & d_last);
  end

endmodule
```
//Note: For the previous timestamp of the record in, the prev record should be placed outside the if-else, and it cannot be set to 0 during reset, otherwise it will cause an error.
