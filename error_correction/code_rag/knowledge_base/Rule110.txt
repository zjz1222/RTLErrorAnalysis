[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a 512-bit shift register with a load capability. When the load signal is high, the register loads the input data. When the load signal is low, the register performs a specific bitwise operation on its current contents, which involves a combination of XOR, AND, and OR operations with shifted versions of the register's contents.

[Input Signal Description]:
- clk: Clock signal that triggers the register operations on its rising edge.
- load: Control signal that determines whether to load new data into the register or perform the bitwise operation.
- data[511:0]: 512-bit input data that is loaded into the register when the load signal is high.

[Output Signal Description]:
- q[511:0]: 512-bit output that represents the current state of the register. It either holds the loaded data or the result of the bitwise operation, depending on the state of the load signal.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule(
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [511:0] data,
    output reg [511:0] q
); 

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            q <= data;
        end
        else begin
            q <= (((q[511:0] ^ {q[510:0], 1'b0}) & q[511:1]) | ((q[511:0] | {q[510:0], 1'b0}) & (~q[511:1])));
        end
    end
