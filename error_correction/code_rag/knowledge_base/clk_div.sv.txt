[Keyword]: clk_div.sv

[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
The circuit is a clock divider that divides the input clock frequency by an integer factor specified by the parameter `RATIO`. It generates a slower clock output with a frequency that is 1/RATIO of the input clock frequency. The design includes a warning about the unbalanced duty cycle of the output clock and suggests using an alternative module for a balanced duty cycle.

[Input Signal Description]:
- `clk_i`: The input clock signal that needs to be divided.
- `rst_ni`: An asynchronous reset signal, active low, used to reset the internal state of the clock divider.
- `testmode_i`: A signal to enable test mode, which bypasses the clock division and outputs the input clock directly.
- `en_i`: An enable signal that allows the clock division to occur when asserted.

[Output Signal Description]:
- `clk_o`: The output clock signal, which is the divided version of the input clock. In test mode, this signal is the same as the input clock.
