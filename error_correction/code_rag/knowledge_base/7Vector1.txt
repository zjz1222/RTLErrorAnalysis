[Keyword]: 7Vector1

[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design is a simple signal splitter that takes a 16-bit input and divides it into two separate 8-bit outputs. The higher 8 bits of the input are assigned to one output, and the lower 8 bits are assigned to another output.

[Input Signal Description]:
in[15:0]: A 16-bit input signal that is to be split into two 8-bit segments.

[Output Signal Description]:
out_hi[7:0]: An 8-bit output signal representing the higher 8 bits of the input.
out_lo[7:0]: An 8-bit output signal representing the lower 8 bits of the input.

[Design Detail]: 
`default_nettype none     // Disable implicit nets. Reduces some types of bugs.
module top_module( 
    input wire [15:0] in,
    output wire [7:0] out_hi,
    output wire [7:0] out_lo );

    assign out_hi = in[15:8];
    assign out_lo = in[7:0];
    
endmodule
