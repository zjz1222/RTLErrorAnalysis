[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This circuit is a combinational logic circuit that computes two specific output signals, Y2 and Y4, based on the input signals. It uses logical operations to determine the values of these outputs.

[Input Signal Description]:
- y[6:1]: A 6-bit input vector where each bit can be used in logical operations to determine the output.
- w: A single-bit input signal that influences the logic for determining the outputs Y2 and Y4.

[Output Signal Description]:
- Y2: The output is the result of a logical AND operation between the first bit of the input vector y and the negation of the input w.
- Y4: The output is the result of a logical OR operation among several AND operations involving bits 2, 3, 5, and 6 of the input vector y, all ANDed with the input w.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule (
    input [6:1] y,
    input w,
    output Y2,
    output Y4
);

    assign Y2 = y[1] & (~w);
    assign Y4 = (y[2] & w) | (y[3] & w) | (y[5] & w) | (y[6] & w);

endmodule
