[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design is a simple D-type flip-flop with a load-enable feature. It captures the input data based on the clock edge and the load signal. If the load signal (L) is high, the flip-flop captures the data from the `rin` input; otherwise, it captures the data from the `qin` input.

[Input Signal Description]:
- `clk`: Clock signal that triggers the data capture on its rising edge.
- `L`: Load-enable signal that determines which input data to capture.
- `rin`: Data input that is captured when the load-enable signal (L) is high.
- `qin`: Data input that is captured when the load-enable signal (L) is low.

[Output Signal Description]:
- `Q`: The output of the flip-flop, which holds the captured data based on the clock and load-enable conditions.

```verilog
module topmodule (
    input clk,
    input L,
    input rin,
    input qin,
    output reg Q);
    
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        Q <= L ? rin : qin;
    end

endmodule
