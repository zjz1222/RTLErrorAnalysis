[Keyword]: Lfsr5

[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a 5-bit Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) with a specific feedback polynomial. The LFSR generates a pseudo-random sequence of bits. The register is reset to a specific value (5'h1) when the reset signal is active.

[Input Signal Description]:
clk: Clock signal that triggers the LFSR to shift and update its state on the rising edge.
reset: Active-high synchronous reset signal that initializes the LFSR to the value 5'h1.

[Output Signal Description]:
q[4:0]: 5-bit output representing the current state of the LFSR, which changes with each clock cycle based on the feedback logic.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule(
    input clk,
    input reset,    // Active-high synchronous reset to 5'h1
    output [4:0] q
); 

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if(reset) begin
            q <= 5'h1;
        end
        else begin
            q <= {0 ^ q[0], q[4], q[3] ^ q[0], q[2], q[1]};
        end
    end
