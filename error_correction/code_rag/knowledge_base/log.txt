[Keyword]: log

[Design Category]: Arithmetic Circuits

[Design Function Description]:
This design calculates the natural logarithm and the base-10 logarithm of two 32-bit input numbers, `a` and `b`, respectively. The results are scaled by a factor of 1,000,000,000 and output as 128-bit numbers.

[Input Signal Description]:
- `a[31:0]`: A 32-bit input signal representing the number for which the natural logarithm (ln) is to be calculated.
- `b[31:0]`: A 32-bit input signal representing the number for which the base-10 logarithm (log10) is to be calculated.

[Output Signal Description]:
- `a_out[127:0]`: A 128-bit output signal representing the scaled natural logarithm of `a` (ln(a) * 1,000,000,000).
- `b_out[127:0]`: A 128-bit output signal representing the scaled base-10 logarithm of `b` (log10(b) * 1,000,000,000).


[Design Detail]:
module logarithm(input [31:0] a,b,output [127:0] a_out, b_out);
  assign a_out = 1000000000 * $ln(a);
  assign b_out = 1000000000 * $log10(b);
