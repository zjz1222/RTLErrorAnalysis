[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design is a sign-extension circuit that takes an 8-bit input and extends it to a 32-bit output by replicating the sign bit (the most significant bit of the input) 24 times, followed by the original 8-bit input.

[Input Signal Description]:
in[7:0]: An 8-bit input signal that represents a signed integer in 2's complement form.

[Output Signal Description]:
out[31:0]: A 32-bit output signal that is the sign-extended version of the input, where the most significant 24 bits are filled with the sign bit of the input, followed by the original 8-bit input.

[Design Detail]: 
module top_module (
    input [7:0] in,
    output [31:0] out
);
    assign out = {{24{in[7]}}, in};
endmodule
