[Keyword]: dual_comparator

[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
The circuit is a dual comparator that compares two 8-bit numbers, `a` and `b`. It can perform both signed and unsigned comparisons based on the `mode` input. If `mode` is high (1), it performs a signed comparison; if `mode` is low (0), it performs an unsigned comparison. The output `agtb` indicates whether `a` is greater than `b`.

[Input Signal Description]:
- `a[7:0]`: An 8-bit input signal representing the first number to be compared.
- `b[7:0]`: An 8-bit input signal representing the second number to be compared.
- `mode`: A 1-bit input signal that determines the type of comparison. If `mode` is 1, a signed comparison is performed; if `mode` is 0, an unsigned comparison is performed.

[Output Signal Description]:
- `agtb`: A 1-bit output signal that indicates the result of the comparison. It is high (1) if `a` is greater than `b` according to the selected comparison mode, and low (0) otherwise.
