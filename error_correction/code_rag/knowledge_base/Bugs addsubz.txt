[Design Category]: Arithmetic Circuits

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements an 8-bit arithmetic unit that can perform either addition or subtraction based on the control signal `dosub`. It also checks if the result of the operation is zero and sets a flag accordingly.

[Input Signal Description]:
- `dosub`: A control signal (1-bit) that determines the operation. If `dosub` is 0, the circuit performs addition; if 1, it performs subtraction.
- `a[7:0]`: An 8-bit input operand for the arithmetic operation.
- `b[7:0]`: Another 8-bit input operand for the arithmetic operation.

[Output Signal Description]:
- `out[7:0]`: An 8-bit output that holds the result of the arithmetic operation (either `a + b` or `a - b`).
- `resultiszero`: A 1-bit output flag that is set to 1 if the result of the operation (`out`) is zero, otherwise it is set to 0.

[Design Detail]: 
```verilog
// synthesis veriloginputversion verilog2001
module topmodule ( 
    input dosub,
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output reg [7:0] out,
    output reg resultiszero
);//

    always @(*) begin
        case (dosub)
          0: out = a+b;
          1: out = a-b;
        endcase

        if (out == 0)
            resultiszero = 1;
        else
            resultiszero = 0;
    end

endmodule
