[Keyword]: CS450timer

[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design is a countdown counter with a loadable initial value. It counts down from a specified value and outputs a terminal count signal when the counter reaches zero.

[Input Signal Description]:
- clk: Clock signal that triggers the counter to decrement on each positive edge.
- load: Control signal to load the counter with a new value from the data input.
- data[9:0]: 10-bit input signal that provides the initial value to load into the counter when the load signal is active.

[Output Signal Description]:
- tc: Terminal count output signal that goes high when the counter reaches zero, indicating the countdown is complete.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule(
    input clk, 
    input load, 
    input [9:0] data, 
    output tc
);
    reg [9:0] counter;
    
    always@(posedge clk) begin
        if (load==1'b1) counter <= data;
        else counter <= (counter==10'b0)?counter:counter-1;
    end
    
    assign tc = (counter == 10'b0)?1'b1:1'b0;
