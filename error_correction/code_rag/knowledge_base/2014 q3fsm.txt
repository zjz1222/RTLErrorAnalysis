[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a finite state machine (FSM) with two states, A and B. The FSM transitions between these states based on the input signal `s`. The circuit also processes an input signal `w` to form a 3-bit sequence `wnew` and uses a counter to determine when to evaluate the sequence. The output `z` is asserted when the counter reaches a specific value and the sequence `wnew` matches one of the specified patterns.

[Input Signal Description]:
- `clk`: Clock signal for synchronizing state transitions and operations.
- `reset`: Synchronous reset signal to initialize the state and other registers.
- `s`: Input signal that determines state transitions in the FSM.
- `w`: Input signal that is used to form a 3-bit sequence `wnew`.

[Output Signal Description]:
- `z`: Output signal that is asserted when the counter reaches 1 and the sequence `wnew` matches one of the patterns: 3'b011, 3'b110, or 3'b101.
