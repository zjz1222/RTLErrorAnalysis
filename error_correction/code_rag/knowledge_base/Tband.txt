[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
The design is a simple testbench for a 2-input AND gate. It applies different 2-bit input combinations to the AND gate and observes the output.

[Input Signal Description]:
in[1:0]: A 2-bit input signal that changes over time to test the AND gate with different input combinations.

[Output Signal Description]:
out: The output of the AND gate, which will be the logical AND of the two input bits.
