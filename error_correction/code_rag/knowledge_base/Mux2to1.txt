[Keyword]: Mux2to1

[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a 2-to-1 multiplexer. It selects one of the two input signals, `a` or `b`, based on the value of the selection signal `sel`.

[Input Signal Description]:
- `a`: One of the input signals to the multiplexer.
- `b`: The other input signal to the multiplexer.
- `sel`: A selection signal that determines which input signal is passed to the output. If `sel` is 1, `b` is selected; if `sel` is 0, `a` is selected.

[Output Signal Description]:
- `out`: The output signal of the multiplexer, which is either `a` or `b` depending on the value of `sel`.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule( 
    input a, b, sel,
    output out ); 

    assign out = sel ? b : a;
    
endmodule
