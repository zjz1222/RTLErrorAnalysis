[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design is a simple testbench that generates a sequence of input patterns over time. It uses an initial block to simulate changes in the output signals A and B at specific time intervals.

[Input Signal Description]:
There are no explicit input signals in this module. The design is focused on generating output patterns over time.

[Output Signal Description]:
A: A reg type output signal that changes its value over time according to the specified timing in the initial block.
B: A reg type output signal that also changes its value over time according to the specified timing in the initial block.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule ( output reg A, output reg B );//
    
    // generate input patterns here
    initial begin
        A = 0;
        B = 0;
        #10 A = 1;
        #5  B = 1;
        #5  A = 0;
        #20 B = 0;
    end
