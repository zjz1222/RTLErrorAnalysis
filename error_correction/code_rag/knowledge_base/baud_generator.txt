[Keyword]: baud_generator

[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]: 
The circuit is a baud rate generator, which is used to generate a periodic tick signal (`s_tick`) at a specific frequency. This is typically used in serial communication to synchronize data transmission and reception by providing a clock signal at the desired baud rate.

[Input Signal Description]: 
- `clk`: The clock input signal that drives the sequential logic.
- `rst_n`: An active-low reset signal that initializes the counter to zero when asserted.

[Output Signal Description]: 
- `s_tick`: A periodic output signal that goes high for one clock cycle every N clock cycles, where N is a parameter that determines the frequency of the tick signal.














[Design Detail]:
