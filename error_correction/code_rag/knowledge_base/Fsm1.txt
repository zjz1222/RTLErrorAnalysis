[Keyword]: Fsm1

[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a simple finite state machine (FSM) with two states, A and B. The FSM transitions between these states based on the input signal 'in'. The state transitions are controlled by a clock signal and an asynchronous reset signal. The output 'out' is determined by the current state of the FSM.

[Input Signal Description]:
- clk: Clock signal that synchronizes the state transitions.
- areset: Asynchronous reset signal that forces the FSM to state B when asserted.
- in: Input signal that influences the state transitions between A and B.

[Output Signal Description]:
- out: Output signal that is high when the FSM is in state B and low when in state A.

[Design Detail]: 
```verilog
module topmodule(
    input clk,
    input areset,    // Asynchronous reset to state B
    input in,
    output out
);  

    parameter A = 0, B = 1; 
    reg state, nextstate;

    always @(*) begin    // This is a combinational always block
        // State transition logic
        case (state)
            A: nextstate <= in ? A : B;
            B: nextstate <= in ? B : A;
        endcase
    end

    always @(posedge clk, posedge areset) begin    // This is a sequential always block
        // State flip-flops with asynchronous reset
        if (areset) begin
            state <= B;
        end
        else begin
            state <= nextstate;
        end
    end

    // Output logic
    assign out = (state == B);

endmodule
