[Design Category]: Interface Circuits

[Design Function Description]:
This is a dummy circuit designed to mitigate Open Pin warnings in synthesis tools like Vivado. It serves as a placeholder to prevent warnings about unused input pins by assigning them to a logic variable.

[Input Signal Description]:
d_i: A logic input signal that is intended to be connected to prevent open pin warnings.

[Output Signal Description]:
There is no output signal in this design. The purpose is to handle the input signal to avoid synthesis warnings.
