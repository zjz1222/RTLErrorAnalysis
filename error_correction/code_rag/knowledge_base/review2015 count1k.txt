[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a 10-bit binary counter that counts from 0 to 999. The counter increments on each positive edge of the clock signal. If the counter reaches 999, it resets to 0 on the next clock cycle. Additionally, the counter can be reset to 0 at any time using the reset signal.

[Input Signal Description]:
clk: Clock signal that triggers the counter to increment on its positive edge.
reset: Asynchronous reset signal that sets the counter to 0 when asserted.

[Output Signal Description]:
q[9:0]: A 10-bit output representing the current count value of the counter, ranging from 0 to 999.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output [9:0] q);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            q <= 0;
        end
        else if (q == 999) begin
            q <= 0;
        end
        else begin
            q <= q + 1;
        end
    end
