[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a 32-bit adder using two 16-bit adders. It takes two 32-bit input numbers and produces their 32-bit sum. The addition is performed in two stages: the lower 16 bits are added first, and the carry-out from this addition is used as the carry-in for the addition of the upper 16 bits.

[Input Signal Description]:
a[31:0]: A 32-bit input operand for the addition.
b[31:0]: Another 32-bit input operand for the addition.

[Output Signal Description]:
sum[31:0]: The 32-bit result of the addition of inputs 'a' and 'b'.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule(
    input [31:0] a,
    input [31:0] b,
    output [31:0] sum
);
    
    wire cin1, cout1, cout2;
    wire [15:0] sum1, sum2;
    assign cin1 = 0;
    
    add16 instance1(.a(a[15:0]), .b(b[15:0]), .cin(cin1), .cout(cout1), .sum(sum1));
    add16 instance2(.a(a[31:16]), .b(b[31:16]), .cin(cout1), .cout(cout2), .sum(sum2));
    
    assign sum = {sum2, sum1};
