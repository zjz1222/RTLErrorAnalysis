[Keyword]: cb_filter_pkg.sv

[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This package defines a structure for seeds used in a combinational logic context, specifically for permutation and XOR operations. It provides a template for how seeds can be organized and includes an example of seed initialization.

[Input Signal Description]:
There are no direct input signals in this package as it primarily defines a data structure. However, the structure `cb_seed_t` includes two unsigned integer fields: `PermuteSeed` and `XorSeed`, which are intended to be used as seeds for permutation and XOR operations, respectively.

[Output Signal Description]:
There are no direct output signals in this package. The package provides a structured way to handle seed data, which can be used in other modules or functions that perform operations requiring these seeds.
