[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a simple sequential circuit that performs a bitwise XOR operation between the current output and the input signal on every rising edge of the clock. It effectively toggles the output bit based on the input signal.

[Input Signal Description]:
clk: Clock signal that triggers the operation on its rising edge.
in: Input signal that is XORed with the current output to determine the next state of the output.

[Output Signal Description]:
out: The output signal that holds the result of the XOR operation between the previous output and the input signal. It is updated on each rising edge of the clock.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule (
    input clk,
    input in, 
    output reg out
);
    
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        out <= out ^ in;
    end

endmodule
