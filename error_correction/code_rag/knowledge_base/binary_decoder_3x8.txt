[Keyword]: binary_decoder_3x8

[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
The circuit is a 3-to-8 binary decoder. It takes a 3-bit binary input and decodes it into an 8-bit output, where only one of the output bits is set to '1' based on the input value, and the rest are '0'. This is achieved by using two 2-to-4 decoders, with the most significant bit of the input used to enable one of the two decoders.

[Input Signal Description]:
a[2:0]: A 3-bit input signal that represents a binary number from 0 to 7. This input is used to determine which one of the 8 output lines will be activated.

[Output Signal Description]:
bcode[7:0]: An 8-bit output signal where only one bit is set to '1' based on the input value, and the rest are '0'. This represents the decoded output of the 3-to-8 decoder.
