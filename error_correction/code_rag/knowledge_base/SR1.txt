[Keyword]: SR1

[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design is an 8-bit shift register with synchronous reset and load capabilities. It can load an 8-bit input value or shift its current value to the right by one bit position on each clock cycle.

[Input Signal Description]:
- rst: A reset signal that, when high, resets the output `q1` to 0.
- l_s: A load/shift control signal. When high, the input `d` is loaded into `q1`. When low, `q1` is shifted right by one bit.
- clk: A clock signal that triggers the operations on the rising edge.
- d[7:0]: An 8-bit data input that is loaded into `q1` when `l_s` is high.

[Output Signal Description]:
- q1[7:0]: An 8-bit output register that holds the current state of the shift register. It can be reset, loaded with a new value, or shifted right based on the control signals.
