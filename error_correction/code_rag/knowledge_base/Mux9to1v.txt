[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a 16-bit wide, 9-to-1 multiplexer. It selects one of the nine 16-bit input signals (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i) based on a 4-bit selection signal (sel). If the selection signal is outside the range of 0 to 8, the output defaults to 16'hffff.

[Input Signal Description]:
- a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i: Each is a 16-bit input signal.
- sel[3:0]: A 4-bit selection signal that determines which input signal is routed to the output. It can represent values from 0 to 8.

[Output Signal Description]:
- out[15:0]: A 16-bit output signal that reflects the value of the selected input signal based on the sel value. If sel is outside the range of 0 to 8, the output is set to 16'hffff.
