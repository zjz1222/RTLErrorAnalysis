[Keyword]: Fsm2s

[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a JK flip-flop with synchronous reset functionality. The circuit transitions between two states, ON and OFF, based on the inputs j and k. The output reflects the current state of the flip-flop.

[Input Signal Description]:
- clk: Clock signal used to synchronize state transitions.
- reset: Synchronous reset signal that sets the state to OFF when asserted.
- j: Input signal that, when high, transitions the state from OFF to ON.
- k: Input signal that, when high, transitions the state from ON to OFF.

[Output Signal Description]:
- out: Output signal that indicates the current state of the flip-flop. It is high when the state is ON and low when the state is OFF.

[Design Detail]: 
```verilog
module topmodule(
    input clk,
    input reset,    // Synchronous reset to OFF
    input j,
    input k,
    output out); //  

    parameter OFF = 0, ON = 1; 
    reg state, nextstate;

    always @(*) begin
        // State transition logic
        case (state)
            ON: nextstate <= k ? OFF : ON;
            OFF: nextstate <= j ? ON : OFF;
        endcase
    end

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        // State flip-flops with synchronous reset
        if (reset) begin
            state <= OFF;
        end
        else begin
            state <= nextstate;
        end
    end

    // Output logic
    // assign out = (state == ...);
    assign out = (state == ON);

endmodule
