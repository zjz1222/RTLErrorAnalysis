[Keyword]: edge_propagator.sv

[Design Category]: Interface Circuits

[Design Function Description]:
The circuit is designed to propagate an edge signal from one clock domain to another. It ensures that a signal transition (edge) is reliably transferred between two asynchronous clock domains, which is a common requirement in systems where different parts operate on different clock frequencies.

[Input Signal Description]:
- `clk_tx_i`: Clock signal for the transmitting domain.
- `rstn_tx_i`: Active-low reset signal for the transmitting domain.
- `edge_i`: Input edge signal that needs to be propagated to the receiving domain.
- `clk_rx_i`: Clock signal for the receiving domain.
- `rstn_rx_i`: Active-low reset signal for the receiving domain.

[Output Signal Description]:
- `edge_o`: Output edge signal that has been propagated to the receiving domain.
