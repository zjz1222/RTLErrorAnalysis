[Design Category]: Control Circuits

[Design Function Description]:
This design is a control circuit that manages two outputs based on specific conditions. It determines whether to shut off a computer based on CPU temperature and whether to keep driving based on arrival status and gas tank level.

[Input Signal Description]:
- `cpu_overheated`: A signal indicating whether the CPU is overheated. If true, the computer should be shut off.
- `arrived`: A signal indicating whether the destination has been reached. If false, the system checks the gas tank status to decide on driving.
- `gas_tank_empty`: A signal indicating whether the gas tank is empty. If true and the destination is not reached, driving should stop.

[Output Signal Description]:
- `shut_off_computer`: A control signal that is set to 1 if the CPU is overheated, indicating the computer should be shut off.
- `keep_driving`: A control signal that is set to 1 if the destination has not been reached and the gas tank is not empty, indicating to keep driving.
