[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a combinational logic circuit that evaluates a 3-bit input and produces a single output. The output is determined based on whether the 3-bit input represents a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7) or not (0, 1, 4, 6).

[Input Signal Description]:
- x3, x2, x1: These are the three input signals that form a 3-bit binary number. The combination of these inputs is used to determine the output.

[Output Signal Description]:
- f: This is the output signal that is set to 1 if the 3-bit input represents a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7) and set to 0 otherwise.

[Design Detail]: 
```verilog
module topmodule( 
    input x3,
    input x2,
    input x1,  // three inputs
    output reg f   // one output
);
    wire [2:0] tmp;
    assign tmp = {x3,x2,x1};
    always @(*) begin
        case(tmp)
            2,3,5,7: begin
                f = 1;
            end
            0,1,4,6: begin
                f = 0;
            end
        endcase
    end

endmodule
