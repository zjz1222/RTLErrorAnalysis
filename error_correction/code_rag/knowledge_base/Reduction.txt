[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design calculates the parity of an 8-bit input vector. The parity is determined by performing a bitwise XOR operation across all bits of the input. The output is 1 if the number of 1s in the input is odd, and 0 if the number of 1s is even.

[Input Signal Description]:
in[7:0]: An 8-bit input signal whose parity is to be calculated.

[Output Signal Description]:
parity: A single-bit output signal that represents the parity of the input. It is 1 if the number of 1s in the input is odd, and 0 if even.

[Design Detail]: 
module top_module (
    input [7:0] in,
    output parity); 
    assign parity = ^ in[7:0];
endmodule
