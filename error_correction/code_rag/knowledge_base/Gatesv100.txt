[Keyword]: Gatesv100

[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
The circuit processes a 100-bit input vector to produce three different output vectors. It calculates bitwise operations between adjacent bits of the input vector to generate the outputs: `outboth` for bitwise AND, `outany` for bitwise OR, and `outdifferent` for detecting differences between adjacent bits.

[Input Signal Description]:
`in[99:0]`: A 100-bit input vector that serves as the source for bitwise operations to generate the outputs.

[Output Signal Description]:
- `outboth[98:0]`: A 99-bit output vector where each bit is the result of a bitwise AND operation between adjacent bits of the input vector.
- `outany[99:1]`: A 99-bit output vector where each bit is the result of a bitwise OR operation between adjacent bits of the input vector.
- `outdifferent[99:0]`: A 100-bit output vector where each bit indicates whether two adjacent bits in the input vector are different (1 if different, 0 if the same).

[Design Detail]: 
```verilog
module topmodule( 
    input [99:0] in,
    output [98:0] outboth,
    output [99:1] outany,
    output [99:0] outdifferent );
    
    integer i;
    
    always @(*) begin
        for(i = 0; i < 99; i ++) begin
            outboth[i] = in[i] & in[i+1];
            outany[i+1] = in[i] | in[i+1];
            outdifferent[i] = (in[i] != in[i+1]) ? 1:0;
        end
        outdifferent[99] = (in[0] != in[99]) ? 1:0;
    end

endmodule
