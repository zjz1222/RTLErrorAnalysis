[Keyword]: mux2X1

[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a 2-to-1 multiplexer. It selects one of the two input signals (in0 or in1) based on the value of the selection signal (sel) and outputs the selected input.

[Input Signal Description]:
- in0: First input signal to the multiplexer.
- in1: Second input signal to the multiplexer.
- sel: Selection signal that determines which input (in0 or in1) is passed to the output. If sel is 1, in1 is selected; if sel is 0, in0 is selected.

[Output Signal Description]:
- out: The output signal of the multiplexer, which is either in0 or in1 based on the value of the sel signal.


[Design Detail]:
module mux2X1( in0,in1,sel,out);
input in0,in1;
input sel;
output out;
assign out=(sel)?in1:in0;
endmodule
