[Keyword]: adder

[Design Category]: Arithmetic Circuits

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements an 8-bit binary adder. It takes two 8-bit binary numbers as inputs and produces an 8-bit sum and a carry-out as outputs.

[Input Signal Description]:
a[7:0]: An 8-bit input signal representing the first operand for the addition.
b[7:0]: An 8-bit input signal representing the second operand for the addition.

[Output Signal Description]:
s[7:0]: An 8-bit output signal representing the sum of the two input operands.
c: A 1-bit output signal representing the carry-out from the most significant bit of the addition.


[Design Detail]:
//Adder
 
 module adder(a,b,c,s);
 input [7:0] a,b;
 output [7:0] s;
 output c; 
 assign {c,s}=a+b;
 endmodule
