[Keyword]: Alwayscase

[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a 4-bit wide, 6-to-1 multiplexer. It selects one of the six 4-bit input data lines based on a 3-bit selection signal and outputs the selected data.

[Input Signal Description]:
- sel[2:0]: A 3-bit selection signal that determines which of the six input data lines is routed to the output. It can represent values from 0 to 5.
- data0[3:0] to data5[3:0]: Six 4-bit input data lines from which one is selected based on the value of the selection signal.

[Output Signal Description]:
- out[3:0]: A 4-bit output that carries the value of the selected input data line based on the selection signal.
