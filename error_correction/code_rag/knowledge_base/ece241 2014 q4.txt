[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design is a sequential logic circuit that uses a 3-bit register `Q` to perform bitwise operations based on the input `x` at every positive edge of the clock signal `clk`. The output `z` is determined by the logical negation of the OR operation on the bits of `Q`.

[Input Signal Description]:
- `clk`: Clock signal that triggers the sequential logic on its positive edge.
- `x`: Input signal used to modify the state of the 3-bit register `Q`.

[Output Signal Description]:
- `z`: Output signal that is the negation of the OR operation on the bits of the register `Q`. It is initially set to 1.

[Design Detail]: 
```verilog
module topmodule (
    input clk,
    input x,
    output z
); 
    reg [2:0] Q;
    initial z = 1;
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        Q[0] = Q[0] ^ x;
        Q[1] = ~Q[1] & x;
        Q[2] = ~Q[2] | x;
        z = ~(Q[0] | Q[1] | Q[2]); 
    end

endmodule
