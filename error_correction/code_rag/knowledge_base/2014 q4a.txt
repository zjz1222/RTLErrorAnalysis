[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design is a sequential logic circuit that implements a flip-flop with additional control signals for enabling, loading, and resetting. The output Q is updated based on the clock signal and the control inputs.

[Input Signal Description]:
- clk: Clock signal that triggers the update of the output Q.
- w: Data input used when the enable signal E is active.
- R: Data input used when the load signal L is active.
- E: Enable signal that determines whether the input w should be used to update the output.
- L: Load signal that determines whether the input R should be used to update the output.

[Output Signal Description]:
- Q: The output of the flip-flop, which is updated based on the control signals and the clock.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule (
    input clk,
    input w, R, E, L,
    output Q

    reg tmp;
    //not use <=
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        tmp = E ? w : Q;
        Q = L ? R : tmp;
    end
