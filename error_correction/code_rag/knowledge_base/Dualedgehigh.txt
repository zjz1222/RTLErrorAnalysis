[Keyword]: Dualedgehigh

[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design is a dual-edge triggered flip-flop is triggered on both edges of the clock that captures the input signal `d` on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal `clk`. It uses two registers to store the value of `d` at different clock edges and outputs one of these values based on the current state of the clock.

[Input Signal Description]:
- `clk`: Clock signal used to synchronize the capturing of the input signal `d`. The circuit responds to both the positive and negative edges of this signal.
- `d`: Data input signal that is captured and stored in the `status` register on both edges of the clock.

[Output Signal Description]:
- `q`: Output signal that reflects the value of `d` captured at the most recent clock edge. If the clock is high, it outputs the value captured on the positive edge; if the clock is low, it outputs the value captured on the negative edge.

[Design Detail]: 
```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input d,
  output reg q
);

  reg qp, qn;
  always @(posedge clk)
    qp <= d;
  always @(negedge clk)
    qn <= d;

  always @(*)
    q <= clk ? qp : qn;

endmodule
