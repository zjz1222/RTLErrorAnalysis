[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a logic circuit that calculates the Sum of Products (SOP) and Product of Sums (POS) for a given set of inputs. The circuit outputs the same result for both SOP and POS forms, indicating that the logic expressions are equivalent.

[Input Signal Description]:
a, b, c, d: These are the 1-bit input signals to the circuit. They represent the variables used in the logic expressions for SOP and POS.

[Output Signal Description]:
outsop: This is the output signal representing the result of the Sum of Products expression.
outpos: This is the output signal representing the result of the Product of Sums expression. In this design, it is equivalent to outsop.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule (
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    input d,
    output outsop,
    output outpos
); 
    
    assign outsop = (~a & ~b & c) | (b & c & d) | (a & c & d);
    assign outpos = outsop;

endmodule
