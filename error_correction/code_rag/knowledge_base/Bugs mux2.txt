[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]: 
This design implements an 8-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer. It selects between two 8-bit input signals, 'a' and 'b', based on the value of the single-bit input 'sel'. If 'sel' is 1, the output 'out' will be the value of 'a'; if 'sel' is 0, the output 'out' will be the value of 'b'.

[Input Signal Description]:
- sel: A 1-bit selection signal that determines which input (either 'a' or 'b') is passed to the output.
- a[7:0]: An 8-bit input signal that is selected when 'sel' is 1.
- b[7:0]: An 8-bit input signal that is selected when 'sel' is 0.

[Output Signal Description]:
- out[7:0]: An 8-bit output signal that reflects the value of either input 'a' or 'b', depending on the value of 'sel'.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule (
    input sel,
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] out
);
    assign out = sel ? a : b;
endmodule
