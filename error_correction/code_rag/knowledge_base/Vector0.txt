[Keyword]: Vector0

[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design is a simple signal routing circuit that takes a 3-bit input vector and directly assigns it to a 3-bit output vector. Additionally, it breaks out each bit of the output vector into separate output signals.

[Input Signal Description]:
vec[2:0]: A 3-bit input vector that serves as the source of the data to be routed to the outputs.

[Output Signal Description]:
outv[2:0]: A 3-bit output vector that directly mirrors the input vector.
o0: A single-bit output that corresponds to the least significant bit of the input vector.
o1: A single-bit output that corresponds to the middle bit of the input vector.
o2: A single-bit output that corresponds to the most significant bit of the input vector.

[Design Detail]: 
module top_module ( 
    input wire [2:0] vec,
    output wire [2:0] outv,
    output wire o2,
    output wire o1,
    output wire o0
);
    assign outv = vec;
    assign o0 = outv[0];
    assign o1 = outv[1];
    assign o2 = outv[2];
