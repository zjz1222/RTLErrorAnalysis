[Design Category]: Control Circuits

[Design Function Description]:
This design decodes a 16-bit scancode input to determine the direction of a key press. It sets one of the four directional outputs (left, down, right, up) based on the specific scancode received.

[Input Signal Description]:
scancode[15:0]: A 16-bit input signal representing the scancode of a key press. Specific scancodes correspond to directional keys.

[Output Signal Description]:
left: A signal that is set to 1 when the scancode corresponds to the left direction key.
down: A signal that is set to 1 when the scancode corresponds to the down direction key.
right: A signal that is set to 1 when the scancode corresponds to the right direction key.
up: A signal that is set to 1 when the scancode corresponds to the up direction key.
