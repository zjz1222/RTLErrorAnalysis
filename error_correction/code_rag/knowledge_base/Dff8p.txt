[Keyword]: Dff8p

[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design is an 8-bit negative-edge triggered D flip-flop with an asynchronous reset. When the reset signal is active, the output is set to a predefined value (0x34). Otherwise, on the negative edge of the clock, the output follows the input data.

[Input Signal Description]:
- clk: Clock signal used to trigger the flip-flop on its negative edge.
- reset: Asynchronous reset signal. When high, it sets the output to a predefined value (0x34).
- d[7:0]: 8-bit data input signal that is captured on the negative edge of the clock when reset is not active.

[Output Signal Description]:
- q[7:0]: 8-bit output signal that holds the value of the input data 'd' on the negative edge of the clock, or the reset value (0x34) when reset is active.

    input clk,

        else begin
            q <= d;
