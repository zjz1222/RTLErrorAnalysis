[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a 4-bit shift register with additional functionality to decrement the register value. The register can either shift its contents left by one bit and load a new bit from the input, or decrement its value by 1, depending on the control signals.

[Input Signal Description]:
- clk: Clock signal that triggers the operations on the rising edge.
- shiftena: Control signal to enable the shift operation. When high, the register shifts left and loads the new bit from the 'data' input.
- countena: Control signal to enable the count operation. When high, the register decrements its current value by 1.
- data: Input data bit to be shifted into the register when 'shiftena' is high.

[Output Signal Description]:
- q[3:0]: 4-bit output representing the current state of the register. It reflects the result of either the shift operation or the decrement operation based on the control signals.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule (
    input clk,
    input shiftena,
    input countena,
    input data,
    output [3:0] q);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (shiftena) begin
            q <= {q[2:0], data};  // an useful skill
        end
        else if (countena) begin
            q <= q - 1;
        end
        else begin
            q <= q;
        end
    end
