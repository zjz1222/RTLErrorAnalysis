[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a simple combinational logic circuit that generates a 4-bit output vector based on the logical operations performed on two input signals, c and d.

[Input Signal Description]:
c: A single-bit input signal.
d: A single-bit input signal.

[Output Signal Description]:
muxin[3:0]: A 4-bit output vector where each bit is the result of a different logical operation on the inputs c and d. Specifically:
- muxin[0] is the result of the logical OR operation between c and d.
- muxin[1] is a constant 0.
- muxin[2] is the logical NOT of d.
- muxin[3] is the result of the logical AND operation between c and d.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule (
    input c,
    input d,
    output [3:0] muxin
); 
    
    assign muxin[0] = c | d;
    assign muxin[1] = 0;
    assign muxin[2] = ~d;
    assign muxin[3] = c & d;

endmodule
