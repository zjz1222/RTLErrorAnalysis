[Keyword]: Fsm3

[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a finite state machine (FSM) with four states (A, B, C, D). The FSM transitions between these states based on the input signal 'in'. The output 'out' is asserted when the FSM is in state D. The FSM also includes an asynchronous reset to initialize the state to A.

[Input Signal Description]:
- clk: Clock signal used to synchronize state transitions.
- in: Input signal that influences state transitions.
- areset: Asynchronous reset signal that initializes the FSM to state A when asserted.

[Output Signal Description]:
- out: Output signal that is asserted (set to 1) when the FSM is in state D, otherwise it is deasserted (set to 0).

[Design Detail]: 
```verilog
module topmodule(
    input clk,
    input in,
    input areset,
    output out); //
    
    reg [2:0] state, nextstate;
    parameter A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4; 
    // State transition logic
    always @(*) begin
        case (state)
            A: nextstate <= in ? B : A;
            B: nextstate <= in ? B : C;
            C: nextstate <= in ? D : A;
            D: nextstate <= in ? B : C;
        endcase
    end

    // State flip-flops with asynchronous reset
    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if(areset) begin
            state <= A;
        end else begin
            state <= nextstate;
        end
    end

    // Output logic
    assign out = (state == D);
endmodule
