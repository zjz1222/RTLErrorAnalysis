[Keyword]: CS450counter2bc

[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a 2-bit saturating counter, often used in branch prediction logic. The counter has four states: Strongly Not Taken (SNT), Weakly Not Taken (WNT), Weakly Taken (WT), and Strongly Taken (ST). The state transitions are determined by the `trainvalid` and `traintaken` signals, which indicate whether a branch prediction should be updated and whether the branch was actually taken, respectively.

[Input Signal Description]:
- `clk`: Clock signal used to synchronize state transitions.
- `areset`: Asynchronous reset signal that initializes the state to Weakly Not Taken (WNT).
- `trainvalid`: Signal indicating whether the current training data is valid and should be used to update the state.
- `traintaken`: Signal indicating whether the branch was actually taken, used to determine the next state.

[Output Signal Description]:
- `state[1:0]`: 2-bit output representing the current state of the saturating counter, which can be one of the four states: SNT, WNT, WT, or ST.
