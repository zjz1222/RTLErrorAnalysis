[Keyword]: Adder3

[Design Category]: Arithmetic Circuits

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a 3-bit ripple carry adder. It takes two 3-bit binary numbers and a carry-in bit as inputs and produces a 3-bit sum and a 3-bit carry-out as outputs. The adder performs bitwise addition, propagating carry bits from the least significant bit to the most significant bit.

[Input Signal Description]:
- a[2:0]: A 3-bit input representing the first operand for the addition.
- b[2:0]: A 3-bit input representing the second operand for the addition.
- cin: A single-bit input representing the initial carry-in for the least significant bit addition.

[Output Signal Description]:
- sum[2:0]: A 3-bit output representing the sum of the input operands and the carry-in.
- cout[2:0]: A 3-bit output representing the carry-out bits for each bit position of the addition.

```verilog
module topmodule( 
    input [2:0] a, b,
    input cin,
    output [2:0] cout,
    output [2:0] sum );
    
    integer i;
    assign sum[0] = a[0] ^ b[0] ^ cin;
    assign cout[0] = a[0] & b[0] | a[0] & cin | b[0] & cin;
    always @(*) begin
        for(i = 1; i < 3; i=i+1) begin
            sum[i] = a[i] ^ b[i] ^ cout[i-1];
            cout[i] = a[i] & b[i] | a[i] & cout[i-1] | b[i] & cout[i-1];
        end
    end
