[Keyword]: adder32

[Design Category]: Arithmetic Circuits

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a 32-bit binary adder with carry-in and carry-out functionality. It takes two 32-bit binary numbers and an additional carry-in bit as inputs, and produces a 32-bit sum and a carry-out bit as outputs.

[Input Signal Description]:
- A[31:0]: A 32-bit input operand for the addition.
- B[31:0]: Another 32-bit input operand for the addition.
- Ci: A single-bit carry-in input that is added to the sum of A and B.

[Output Signal Description]:
- S[31:0]: A 32-bit output representing the sum of the inputs A, B, and the carry-in Ci.
- Co: A single-bit carry-out output that indicates an overflow from the most significant bit of the sum.


[Design Detail]:
module Adder32 (A, B, Ci, S, Co);

input[31:0] A;
input[31:0] B;
input Ci;
output[31:0] S;
output Co;
wire[32:0] Sum33;
assign Sum33 = A + B + Ci ;
assign S = Sum33[31:0] ;
assign Co = Sum33[32] ;
endmodule
