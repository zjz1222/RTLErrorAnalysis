[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This is a simple pass-through circuit that assigns the input signal directly to the output signal. It is designed to prevent the signal from being removed during synthesis by using the `(* no_ungroup *)` attribute, which ensures that the module is not optimized away or altered during synthesis.

[Input Signal Description]:
d_i: A parameterized input signal of type T, which is a logic vector of width specified by the parameter `Width`. The default width is 1.

[Output Signal Description]:
d_o: A parameterized output signal of type T, which is a logic vector of the same width as the input signal `d_i`. It directly reflects the value of `d_i`.
