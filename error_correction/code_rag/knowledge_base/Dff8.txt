[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design is an 8-bit register that captures and holds the input data on the rising edge of the clock signal. It is a basic storage element used in sequential circuits.

[Input Signal Description]:
clk: Clock signal used to synchronize data capture.
d[7:0]: 8-bit data input signal that is captured and stored on the rising edge of the clock.

[Output Signal Description]:
q[7:0]: 8-bit output signal that holds the value of the input data after being captured on the rising edge of the clock.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] q
);
    
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q <= d;
    end
