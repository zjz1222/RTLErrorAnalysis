[Keyword]: lfsr

[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a 4-bit Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). An LFSR is a shift register whose input bit is a linear function of its previous state. In this case, the feedback is generated by XORing the two most significant bits of the register, and the result is inverted before being fed back into the least significant bit.

[Input Signal Description]:
- clk: Clock signal that triggers the shift operation on the rising edge.
- rst: Asynchronous reset signal that initializes the LFSR output to 0 when high.

[Output Signal Description]:
- out[3:0]: 4-bit output representing the current state of the LFSR.


[Design Detail]:
module lfsr (out, clk, rst);

  output reg [3:0] out;
  input clk, rst;

  wire feedback;

  assign feedback = ~(out[3] ^ out[2]);

always @(posedge clk, posedge rst)
  begin
    if (rst)
      out = 4'b0;
    else
      out = {out[2:0],feedback};
  end
endmodule
