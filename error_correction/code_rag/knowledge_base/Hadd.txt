[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a 1-bit full adder. It takes two 1-bit binary numbers as inputs and produces a sum and a carry-out as outputs.

[Input Signal Description]:
a: 1-bit input signal representing the first binary number.
b: 1-bit input signal representing the second binary number.

[Output Signal Description]:
cout: 1-bit output signal representing the carry-out of the addition.
sum: 1-bit output signal representing the sum of the two input bits.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule( 
    input a, b,
    output cout, sum );
    
    assign {cout, sum} = a + b;

endmodule
