[Keyword]: Tbtff

[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a testbench for a T flip-flop (TFF). The T flip-flop toggles its output on each clock cycle when the T input is high, and it can be reset asynchronously.

[Input Signal Description]:
- clk: Clock signal used to drive the T flip-flop.
- reset: Asynchronous reset signal to initialize or reset the flip-flop.
- t: Toggle input signal for the T flip-flop. When high, it causes the flip-flop to toggle its state on each clock cycle.

[Output Signal Description]:
- q: Output of the T flip-flop, representing the current state of the flip-flop.
