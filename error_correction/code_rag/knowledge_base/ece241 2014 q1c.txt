[Design Category]: Arithmetic Circuits

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements an 8-bit adder with overflow detection. It adds two 8-bit numbers and provides the sum as well as an overflow flag that indicates if the addition resulted in a signed overflow.

[Input Signal Description]:
a[7:0]: An 8-bit input operand for the addition.
b[7:0]: Another 8-bit input operand for the addition.

[Output Signal Description]:
s[7:0]: The 8-bit result of the addition of inputs a and b.
overflow: A 1-bit signal that indicates if a signed overflow occurred during the addition. It is set to 1 if both input operands have the same sign and the result has a different sign.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule (
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] s,
    output overflow
); //
 
    assign s = a + b;
    assign overflow = (a[7] == b[7] && a[7] != s[7]) ? 1 : 0;

endmodule
