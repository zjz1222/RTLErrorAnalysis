[Keyword]: Count1to10

[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design is a 4-bit decade counter that counts from 1 to 10. Upon reaching 10, it resets back to 1. The counter is synchronous with the clock signal and can be reset asynchronously to 1.

[Input Signal Description]:
clk: Clock signal that triggers the counter to increment on each rising edge.
reset: Asynchronous reset signal that sets the counter to 1 when asserted.

[Output Signal Description]:
q[3:0]: 4-bit output representing the current count value of the counter, ranging from 1 to 10.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output [3:0] q);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if(reset) begin
            q <= 1;
        end
        else begin
            if(q == 10) begin
                q <= 1;
            end
            else begin
                q <= q + 1;
            end
        end
    end
