[Keyword]: Mux2to1v

[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a 100-bit wide 2-to-1 multiplexer. It selects between two 100-bit input vectors, `a` and `b`, based on the value of the selection signal `sel`. If `sel` is 1, the output `out` will be equal to `b`; if `sel` is 0, the output `out` will be equal to `a`.

[Input Signal Description]:
- `a[99:0]`: A 100-bit input vector.
- `b[99:0]`: Another 100-bit input vector.
- `sel`: A 1-bit selection signal that determines which input vector is passed to the output.

[Output Signal Description]:
- `out[99:0]`: A 100-bit output vector that is equal to either `a` or `b`, depending on the value of the selection signal `sel`.

[Design Detail]: 
```verilog
module topmodule( 
    input [99:0] a, b,
    input sel,
    output [99:0] out );
    
    assign out = sel ? b : a;

endmodule
