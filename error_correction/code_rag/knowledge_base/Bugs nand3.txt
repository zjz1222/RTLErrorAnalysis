[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a logic circuit that performs a logical AND operation on three input signals and two constant high signals, followed by a NOT operation on the result. The circuit effectively computes the logical NAND of the three input signals.

[Input Signal Description]:
a: First input signal for the AND operation.
b: Second input signal for the AND operation.
c: Third input signal for the AND operation.

[Output Signal Description]:
out: The output signal, which is the logical NOT of the AND operation result of the inputs a, b, c, and two constant high signals.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule (input a, input b, input c, output out);//
    
    wire outtmp;
    assign out = ~outtmp;
    andgate inst1 ( outtmp, a, b, c, 1, 1 );

endmodule
