[Keyword]: Wire4

[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This circuit is a simple wire assignment module that directly connects input signals to output signals. It essentially passes the input values to the outputs without any modification or logic operation.

[Input Signal Description]:
a, b, c: These are the input signals to the module. Each is a single-bit input.

[Output Signal Description]:
w, x, y, z: These are the output signals of the module. Each output is directly assigned the value of one of the input signals. Specifically, w is assigned the value of a, x and y are both assigned the value of b, and z is assigned the value of c.

[Design Detail]: 
module top_module( 
    input a, b, c,
    output w, x, y, z );
    assign w = a;
    assign x = b;
    assign y = b;
    assign z = c;
endmodule
