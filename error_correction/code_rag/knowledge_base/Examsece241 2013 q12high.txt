[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements an 8-bit shift register with a parallel output. The shift register shifts its contents on the rising edge of the clock when the enable signal is high. The output Z is determined by the value of the 3-bit address formed by inputs A, B, and C, which selects one of the bits from the shift register.

[Input Signal Description]:
- clk: Clock signal that triggers the shift operation on its rising edge.
- enable: Control signal that allows the shift operation when high.
- S: Serial input bit that is shifted into the register.
- A, B, C: 3-bit address input used to select which bit of the shift register is output to Z.

[Output Signal Description]:
- Z: Output signal that represents the value of the bit in the shift register at the position specified by the address formed by A, B, and C.

[Design Detail]: 
```verilog
module topmodule (
    input clk,
    input enable,
    input S,
    input A, B, C,
    output Z ); 
    
    reg [7:0] Q = 0;
    
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if(enable) begin
            Q <= {Q[6:0], S};
        end
    end
    
    assign Z = Q[{A, B, C}];

endmodule
