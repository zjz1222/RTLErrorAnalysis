[Keyword]: Andgate

[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a simple 2-input AND gate. The output is the logical AND of the two input signals.

[Input Signal Description]:
a: A single-bit input signal.
b: A single-bit input signal.

[Output Signal Description]:
out: A single-bit output signal that is the result of the logical AND operation between inputs a and b.

[Design Detail]: 
module top_module( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    output out 
);
    assign out = a & b;
endmodule
