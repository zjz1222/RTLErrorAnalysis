[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a 3-bit shift register with parallel load capability. The register can either load new data from the input or shift its current contents based on the control signals.

[Input Signal Description]:
- SW[2:0]: A 3-bit input signal representing the data to be loaded into the register when the load signal is active.
- KEY[1:0]: A 2-bit input signal where KEY[0] is the clock signal and KEY[1] is the load signal. The load signal determines whether the register loads new data or shifts its current contents.

[Output Signal Description]:
- LEDR[2:0]: A 3-bit output signal representing the current state of the register.

[Design Detail]: 
```verilog
module topmodule (
    input [2:0] SW,      // R
    input [1:0] KEY,     // L and clk
    output [2:0] LEDR);  // Q
    
    wire clk, L;
    wire [2:0] R;
    reg [2:0] Q;
    assign clk = KEY[0];
    assign L = KEY[1];
    assign R = SW;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        Q <= {(L) ? R[2] : (Q[1] ^ Q[2]), (L) ? R[1] : Q[0], (L) ? R[0] : Q[2]};
    end
    
    assign LEDR = Q;

endmodule
