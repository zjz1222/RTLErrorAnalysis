[Keyword]: Vector5

[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
The circuit performs bitwise operations on the input signals to generate a 25-bit output. Each 5-bit segment of the output is derived by performing a bitwise NOT operation on a repeated input signal and then XORing it with a vector composed of all input signals.

[Input Signal Description]:
a, b, c, d, e: Single-bit input signals used to generate the output through bitwise operations.

[Output Signal Description]:
out[24:0]: A 25-bit output signal composed of five 5-bit segments, each generated by applying bitwise operations on the input signals.

[Design Detail]: 
module top_module (
    input a, b, c, d, e,
    output [24:0] out );//

    assign out[24:20] = ~ {5{a}} ^ {a, b, c, d, e};
    assign out[19:15] = ~ {5{b}} ^ {a, b, c, d, e};
    assign out[14:10] = ~ {5{c}} ^ {a, b, c, d, e};
    assign out[9:5] = ~ {5{d}} ^ {a, b, c, d, e};
    assign out[4:0] = ~ {5{e}} ^ {a, b, c, d, e};
