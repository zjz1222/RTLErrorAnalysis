[Keyword]: cfsr

[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a cyclic shift right register. It shifts an 8-bit register to the right by one bit position on each positive edge of the clock. The least significant bit is wrapped around to the most significant bit, creating a cyclic effect. The design also logs the shift operations to a file.

[Input Signal Description]:
- clk: Clock signal used to synchronize the shifting operation.
- rst: Asynchronous reset signal used to initialize the register and counter.

[Output Signal Description]:
- The design does not have explicit output ports, but it writes the shift operation results to a file named "cfsr.vec". The file logs the pass number and the current value of the register in hexadecimal format.
