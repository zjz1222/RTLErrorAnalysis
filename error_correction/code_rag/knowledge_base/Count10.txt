[Keyword]: Count10

[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design is a 4-bit decade counter that counts from 0 to 9. It increments the count on each positive edge of the clock signal. When the count reaches 9, it resets back to 0. The counter can also be reset to 0 synchronously when the reset signal is high.

[Input Signal Description]:
- clk: Clock signal that triggers the counter to increment on its positive edge.
- reset: Synchronous active-high reset signal that sets the counter to 0 when high.

[Output Signal Description]:
- q[3:0]: 4-bit output representing the current count value of the counter, ranging from 0 to 9.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule (
    input clk,
    input reset,        // Synchronous active-high reset
    output [3:0] q);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if(reset) begin
            q <= 0;
        end
        else begin
            if(q == 9) begin
                q <= 0;
            end
            else begin
                q <= q + 1;
            end
        end
    end
