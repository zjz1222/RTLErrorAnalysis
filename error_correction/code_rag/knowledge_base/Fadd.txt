[Design Category]: Arithmetic Circuits

[Design Function Description]: 
This design implements a 1-bit full adder. A full adder is a digital circuit that computes the sum of three binary bits, including a carry-in bit, and produces a sum and a carry-out bit.

[Input Signal Description]: 
- a: A 1-bit input representing one of the addends.
- b: A 1-bit input representing the other addend.
- cin: A 1-bit input representing the carry-in from a previous less significant bit addition.

[Output Signal Description]: 
- sum: A 1-bit output representing the sum of the inputs a, b, and cin.
- cout: A 1-bit output representing the carry-out, which is used as the carry-in for the next more significant bit addition.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule( 
    input a, b, cin,
    output cout, sum );
    
    assign sum = a ^ b ^ cin;
    assign cout = a & b | a & cin | b & cin;

endmodule
