[Keyword]: Mux256to1

[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a 256-to-1 multiplexer. It selects one bit from a 256-bit input vector based on an 8-bit selection signal. The selected bit is then output.

[Input Signal Description]:
- in[255:0]: A 256-bit wide input vector containing the data from which a single bit will be selected.
- sel[7:0]: An 8-bit selection signal that determines which bit from the input vector is output. It can represent values from 0 to 255.

[Output Signal Description]:
- out: A single bit output that corresponds to the bit selected from the input vector based on the value of the selection signal.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule( 
    input [255:0] in,
    input [7:0] sel,
    output out 
);
    assign out = in[sel];
endmodule
