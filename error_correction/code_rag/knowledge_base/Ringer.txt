[Keyword]: Ringer

[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This circuit is designed to control a mobile device's alert system, determining whether the device should ring or vibrate based on the input signals. It uses simple logic to decide between activating a ringer or a motor for vibration.

[Input Signal Description]:
- ring: A signal indicating whether the device should alert the user (1 for alert, 0 for no alert).
- vibratemode: A signal indicating the mode of alert (1 for vibrate mode, 0 for ring mode).

[Output Signal Description]:
- ringer: An output signal that activates the ringer to make sound when the device is in ring mode and the ring signal is active.
- motor: An output signal that activates the motor to vibrate when the device is in vibrate mode and the ring signal is active.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule (
    input ring,
    input vibratemode,
    output ringer,       // Make sound
    output motor         // Vibrate
);
    
    assign ringer = ring & (~vibratemode);
    assign motor = ring & vibratemode;
