[Design Category]: Control Circuits

[Design Function Description]:
The design is a fair round-robin arbiter with a lock feature. It manages multiple request signals and grants access to one request at a time in a rotating priority order. The lock feature ensures that once a request is granted, the arbiter maintains the decision until it is re-enabled, even if the arbiter is disabled in the meantime.

[Input Signal Description]:
- `clk_i`: Clock input signal for synchronization.
- `rst_ni`: Active-low reset signal to initialize the arbiter.
- `flush_i`: Signal to clear the arbiter's state.
- `en_i`: Enable signal for the arbiter to process requests.
- `req_i[NUM_REQ-1:0]`: Array of request signals from different sources, where `NUM_REQ` is the number of requests.

[Output Signal Description]:
- `ack_o[NUM_REQ-1:0]`: Array of acknowledge signals corresponding to the request signals, indicating which request has been granted.
- `vld_o`: Valid signal indicating that a request has been acknowledged.
- `idx_o[$clog2(NUM_REQ)-1:0]`: Index output indicating which request has been granted.

// Description: Fair round robin arbiter with lock feature.
//
// The rrarbiter employs fair round robin arbitration - i.e. the priorities
// rotate each cycle.
//
// The lock-in feature prevents the arbiter from changing the arbitration
// decision when the arbiter is disabled. I.e., the index of the first request
// that wins the arbitration will be locked until en_i is asserted again.
//
// Dependencies: relies on rr_arb_tree from common_cells.
