[Keyword]: Countslow

[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a decade counter that counts from 0 to 9. The counter increments on each positive edge of the clock signal when the `slowena` signal is high. If the counter reaches 9, it resets to 0 on the next clock cycle. The counter can also be reset to 0 asynchronously using the `reset` signal.

[Input Signal Description]:
- `clk`: Clock signal that triggers the counter to evaluate and potentially increment its value on each positive edge.
- `slowena`: Enable signal that allows the counter to increment when high. If low, the counter holds its current value.
- `reset`: Asynchronous reset signal that sets the counter value to 0 when high, regardless of the clock or enable signals.

[Output Signal Description]:
- `q[3:0]`: 4-bit output representing the current count value of the counter, ranging from 0 to 9.

[Design Detail]: 
```verilog
module topmodule (
    input clk,
    input slowena,
    input reset,
    output [3:0] q);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if(reset) begin
            q <= 0;
        end
        else begin
            if(slowena) begin
                if(q == 9) begin
                    q <= 0;
                end
                else begin
                    q <= q + 1;
                end
            end
        end
    end
    
endmodule
