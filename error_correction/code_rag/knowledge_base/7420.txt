[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements two 4-input NAND gates. Each NAND gate takes four input signals and produces an output that is the logical NAND of the inputs.

[Input Signal Description]:
- p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d: These are the four input signals for the first NAND gate.
- p2a, p2b, p2c, p2d: These are the four input signals for the second NAND gate.

[Output Signal Description]:
- p1y: This is the output of the first NAND gate, which is the negation of the logical AND of inputs p1a, p1b, p1c, and p1d.
- p2y: This is the output of the second NAND gate, which is the negation of the logical AND of inputs p2a, p2b, p2c, and p2d.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule ( 
    input p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d,
    output p1y,
    input p2a, p2b, p2c, p2d,
    output p2y );

    assign p1y = ~(p1a & p1b & p1c & p1d);
    assign p2y = ~(p2a & p2b & p2c & p2d);
