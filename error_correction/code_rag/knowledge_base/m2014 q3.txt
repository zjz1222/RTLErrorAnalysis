[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a specific logic function using a combination of AND, OR, and NOT gates. The function is defined by a specific Boolean expression that takes a 4-bit input and produces a single output.

[Input Signal Description]:
x[4:1]: A 4-bit input signal where each bit (x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4]) can be either 0 or 1. These bits are used in the logic expression to determine the output.

[Output Signal Description]:
f: A single-bit output signal that is the result of the logic operation defined by the given Boolean expression. It represents the negation of a combination of conditions applied to the input bits.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule (
    input [4:1] x, 
    output f );
    
    assign f = ~((~x[2] & ~x[3] & x[4]) | (~x[1] & x[2] & ~x[3] & x[4]) | (x[1] & x[2] & x[3] & ~x[4]) | (~x[1] & x[2] & ~x[3] & ~x[4]));
