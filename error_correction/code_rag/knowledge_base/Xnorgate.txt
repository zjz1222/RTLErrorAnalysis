[Keyword]: Xnorgate

[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a 1-bit XNOR gate. The circuit outputs the logical XNOR of two input signals, which is true when both inputs are the same (either both 0 or both 1).

[Input Signal Description]:
a: A 1-bit input signal.
b: A 1-bit input signal.

[Output Signal Description]:
out: A 1-bit output signal that represents the XNOR of inputs a and b. It is high (1) when both inputs are the same and low (0) otherwise.

[Design Detail]: 
module top_module( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    output out );
    assign out = ~(a ^ b);
endmodule
