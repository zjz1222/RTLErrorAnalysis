[Keyword]: Vectorr

[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
The circuit is a simple wire assignment that directly maps each bit of an 8-bit input vector to the corresponding bit of an 8-bit output vector. It effectively passes the input to the output without any modification or transformation.

[Input Signal Description]:
in[7:0]: An 8-bit input signal that represents the data to be passed through to the output.

[Output Signal Description]:
out[7:0]: An 8-bit output signal that is a direct copy of the input signal.

[Design Detail]: 
module top_module( 
    input [7:0] in,
    output [7:0] out
);
    assign out = {in[0], in[1], in[2], in[3], in[4], in[5], in[6], in[7]};
endmodule
