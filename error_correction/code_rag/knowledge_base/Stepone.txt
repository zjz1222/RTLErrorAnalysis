[Keyword]: Stepone

[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This circuit is a simple constant output generator that always outputs a logic high ('1').

[Input Signal Description]:
There are no input signals for this design as it is a constant output generator.

[Output Signal Description]:
one: A single-bit output that is always set to logic high ('1').

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule( output one );
    // Insert your code here
    assign one = 1'b1;
endmodule
