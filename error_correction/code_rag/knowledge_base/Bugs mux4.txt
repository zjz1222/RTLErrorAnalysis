[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a 4-to-1 multiplexer using a hierarchical structure of 2-to-1 multiplexers. It selects one of the four 8-bit input signals (a, b, c, d) based on a 2-bit selection signal (sel) and outputs the selected 8-bit signal.

[Input Signal Description]:
- sel[1:0]: A 2-bit selection signal used to choose which of the four input signals (a, b, c, d) is routed to the output. 
- a[7:0]: An 8-bit input signal.
- b[7:0]: An 8-bit input signal.
- c[7:0]: An 8-bit input signal.
- d[7:0]: An 8-bit input signal.

[Output Signal Description]:
- out[7:0]: The 8-bit output signal that corresponds to one of the input signals (a, b, c, or d) based on the value of the selection signal (sel).

[Design Detail]:

    output [7:0] out  ); //

    wire [7:0]  mux0, mux1;

    mux2 mux1ins ( sel[0],    c,    d, mux1 );
    mux2 mux2ins ( sel[1], mux0, mux1,  out );
