[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements two separate logic functions. The first function is a 3-input AND gate followed by an OR gate, which combines two sets of three inputs each. The second function is a 2-input AND gate followed by an OR gate, which combines two sets of two inputs each.

[Input Signal Description]:
- p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d, p1e, p1f: These are the input signals for the first logic function. They are grouped into two sets of three inputs each (p1a, p1b, p1c) and (p1d, p1e, p1f).
- p2a, p2b, p2c, p2d: These are the input signals for the second logic function. They are grouped into two sets of two inputs each (p2a, p2b) and (p2c, p2d).

[Output Signal Description]:
- p1y: This is the output signal for the first logic function. It is the result of OR-ing the outputs of two 3-input AND gates.
- p2y: This is the output signal for the second logic function. It is the result of OR-ing the outputs of two 2-input AND gates.

```verilog
module top_module ( 
    input p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d, p1e, p1f,
    output p1y,
    input p2a, p2b, p2c, p2d,
    output p2y );

    wire abc1, def1, ab2, cd2;
    assign abc1 = p1c & p1b & p1a;
    assign def1 = p1f & p1e & p1d;
    assign p1y = abc1 | def1;
    
    assign ab2 = p2a & p2b;
    assign cd2 = p2c & p2d;
    assign p2y = ab2 | cd2;
    
endmodule
