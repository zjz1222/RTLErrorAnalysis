[Keyword]: Vectorgates

[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design performs bitwise OR, logical OR, and bitwise NOT operations on two 3-bit input vectors. It outputs the results of these operations.

[Input Signal Description]:
a[2:0]: A 3-bit input vector.
b[2:0]: Another 3-bit input vector.

[Output Signal Description]:
out_or_bitwise[2:0]: The result of the bitwise OR operation between inputs a and b.
out_or_logical: The result of the logical OR operation between inputs a and b, which checks if either a or b is non-zero.
out_not[5:0]: A 6-bit output where the upper 3 bits are the bitwise NOT of b and the lower 3 bits are the bitwise NOT of a.

[Design Detail]: 
module top_module( 
    input [2:0] a,
    input [2:0] b,
    output [2:0] out_or_bitwise,
    output out_or_logical,
    output [5:0] out_not
);

    assign out_or_bitwise = a | b;
    assign out_or_logical = a || b;
    assign out_not[5:3] = ~b;
    assign out_not[2:0] = ~a;
