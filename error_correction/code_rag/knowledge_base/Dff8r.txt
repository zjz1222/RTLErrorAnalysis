[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design is an 8-bit synchronous register with a synchronous reset. It captures the input data `d` on the rising edge of the clock `clk` and outputs it as `q`. If the `reset` signal is high during a clock edge, the output `q` is reset to 0.

[Input Signal Description]:
- `clk`: Clock signal used to synchronize the data capture.
- `reset`: Synchronous reset signal. When high, it resets the output `q` to 0 on the next rising edge of `clk`.
- `d[7:0]`: 8-bit data input that is captured and stored in the register on the rising edge of `clk` when `reset` is low.

[Output Signal Description]:
- `q[7:0]`: 8-bit output that holds the value of the input `d` after being captured on the rising edge of `clk`. It is reset to 0 when `reset` is high.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule (
    input clk,
    input reset,            // Synchronous reset
    input [7:0] d,
    output [7:0] q
);
    
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if(reset) begin
            q <= 0;
        end
        else begin
            q <= d;
        end
    end
