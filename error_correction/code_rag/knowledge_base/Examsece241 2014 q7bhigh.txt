[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
The design is a frequency divider that generates a 1 Hz signal from a higher frequency clock input. It uses a series of BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) counters to count clock cycles and produce an output signal, `OneHertz`, that toggles every second. The `cenable` signals control the enablement of each BCD counter stage.

[Input Signal Description]:
- `clk`: The clock input signal that drives the counters.
- `reset`: A signal used to reset the counters to their initial state.

[Output Signal Description]:
- `OneHertz`: A signal that toggles at a frequency of 1 Hz, indicating the completion of a full count cycle.
- `cenable[2:0]`: A 3-bit signal that enables the counting operation of each BCD counter stage based on the current count values.

[Design Detail]: 
```verilog
module topmodule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output OneHertz,
    output [2:0] cenable
); //
    
    wire [3:0] q0, q1, q2;

    bcdcount counter0 (clk, reset, cenable[0], q0);
    bcdcount counter1 (clk, reset, cenable[1], q1);
    bcdcount counter2 (clk, reset, cenable[2], q2);

    assign cenable = {(q1 == 4'd9) && (q0 == 4'd9), q0 == 4'd9, 1'b1};
    assign OneHertz = (q2 == 4'd9) && (q1 == 4'd9) && (q0 == 4'd9);
    
endmodule
