[Keyword]: Zero

[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This circuit is designed to output a constant logic low signal. It is a simple combinational logic circuit that assigns a constant value of 0 to the output.

[Input Signal Description]:
There are no input signals for this module. It is designed to always output a constant value.

[Output Signal Description]:
zero: A single-bit output signal that is always set to logic low (0).

[Design Detail]: 
module top_module(
    output zero
);
    assign zero = 1'b0;
endmodule
