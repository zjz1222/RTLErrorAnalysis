[Keyword]: Alwaysblock1

[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a simple 2-input AND gate using both continuous assignment and procedural assignment within an always block. The circuit outputs the logical AND of two input signals.

[Input Signal Description]:
a: A single-bit input signal.
b: A single-bit input signal.

[Output Signal Description]:
out_assign: A wire output that continuously outputs the result of the logical AND operation between inputs a and b.
out_alwaysblock: A register output that outputs the result of the logical AND operation between inputs a and b, updated whenever there is a change in inputs a or b.

[Design Detail]: 
```verilog
// synthesis verilog_input_version verilog_2001
module top_module(
    input a, 
    input b,
    output wire out_assign,
    output reg out_alwaysblock
);

    assign out_assign = a & b;
    always @(*) out_alwaysblock = a & b;
    
endmodule
```
