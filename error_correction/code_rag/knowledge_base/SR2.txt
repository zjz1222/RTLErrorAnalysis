[Keyword]: SR2

[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design is a simple 8-bit register with synchronous reset and load enable functionality. It captures the input data `d` on the rising edge of the clock when the load enable `l` is low. If the reset `rst` is high, the register is reset to zero.

[Input Signal Description]:
- `clk`: Clock signal used to synchronize the data capture.
- `rst`: Synchronous reset signal. When high, it resets the output `q2` to zero on the rising edge of the clock.
- `l`: Load enable signal. When low, it allows the data `d` to be loaded into the register `q2`.
- `d[7:0]`: 8-bit data input that is captured into the register when `l` is low.

[Output Signal Description]:
- `q2[7:0]`: 8-bit output register that holds the captured data. It retains its value when `l` is high and resets to zero when `rst` is high.


[Design Detail]:
//SR

module s3(clk,rst,d,l,q2);

input clk,rst,l;
input [7:0] d;
output reg [7:0] q2;

always @(posedge clk)
begin
if(rst)
q2=0;
else if(l)
q2=q2;
else
q2=d;
end
endmodule
