[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This design is an 8-bit register with an asynchronous reset. It captures the input data `d` on the rising edge of the clock `clk` and outputs it as `q`. If the asynchronous reset `areset` is active, the output `q` is reset to 0 regardless of the clock.

[Input Signal Description]:
- `clk`: Clock signal used to synchronize the data capture.
- `areset`: Active high asynchronous reset signal that resets the output `q` to 0 when high.
- `d[7:0]`: 8-bit data input that is captured and stored in the register on the rising edge of the clock.

[Output Signal Description]:
- `q[7:0]`: 8-bit output that holds the value of the input `d` after being captured by the clock. It is reset to 0 when `areset` is high.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule (
    input clk,
    input areset,   // active high asynchronous reset
    input [7:0] d,
    output [7:0] q
);
    
    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if(areset) begin
            q <= 0;
        end
        else begin
            q <= d;
        end
    end
