[Keyword]: Edgedetect2

[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:
The circuit detects any edge (rising or falling) on each bit of an 8-bit input signal. It outputs a corresponding 8-bit signal where each bit indicates whether an edge has occurred on the respective input bit since the last clock cycle.

[Input Signal Description]:
- clk: Clock signal used to synchronize the edge detection process.
- in[7:0]: 8-bit input signal whose edges (transitions from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0) are to be detected.

[Output Signal Description]:
- anyedge[7:0]: 8-bit output signal where each bit is set to 1 if an edge is detected on the corresponding input bit, otherwise it is set to 0.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    output [7:0] anyedge
);
    
    integer i;
    reg [7:0] intmp;
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        for(i = 0; i < 8; i = i + 1) begin
            if(intmp[i] != in[i]) begin
                anyedge[i] = 1;
            end
            else begin
                anyedge[i] = 0;
            end
            intmp[i] = in[i];
        end
    end
