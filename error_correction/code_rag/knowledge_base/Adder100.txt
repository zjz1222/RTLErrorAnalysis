[Keyword]: Adder100

[Design Category]: Arithmetic Circuits

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a 100-bit ripple carry adder. It takes two 100-bit binary numbers and an input carry, and produces a 100-bit sum and an output carry. The adder performs bitwise addition of the two input numbers, taking into account the carry from the previous bit addition.

[Input Signal Description]:
- a[99:0]: A 100-bit input signal representing the first operand for the addition.
- b[99:0]: A 100-bit input signal representing the second operand for the addition.
- cin: A single-bit input signal representing the initial carry-in for the least significant bit addition.

[Output Signal Description]:
- sum[99:0]: A 100-bit output signal representing the result of the addition of inputs a and b, including the carry propagation.
- cout: A single-bit output signal representing the final carry-out from the most significant bit addition.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule( 
    input [99:0] a, b,
    input cin,
    output cout,
    output [99:0] sum );
    
    wire [99:0] couttmp;
    assign sum[0] = a[0] ^ b[0] ^ cin;
    assign couttmp[0] = a[0] & b[0] | a[0] & cin | b[0] & cin;
    integer i;
    always @(*) begin
        for(i = 1; i < 100; i = i + 1) begin
            sum[i] = a[i] ^ b[i] ^ couttmp[i-1];
            couttmp[i] = a[i] & b[i] | a[i] & couttmp[i-1] | b[i] & couttmp[i-1];
        end
        cout = couttmp[99];
    end
