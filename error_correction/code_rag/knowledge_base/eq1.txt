[Keyword]: eq1

[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
The circuit is a 1-bit equality comparator. It checks if the two input bits are equal and outputs a high signal if they are.

[Input Signal Description]:
i0, i1: These are the two 1-bit input signals that the circuit compares for equality.

[Output Signal Description]:
eq: This is a 1-bit output signal that is high (1) if the inputs i0 and i1 are equal, and low (0) otherwise.


[Design Detail]:
`timescale 1ns / 1ps

module eq1(
	input wire i0,i1,
	output wire eq
    );
	// signal declaration 
	wire p0, pl; 

	// body 
	// sum of two product terms 
	assign eq = p0 || pl; 
	
	// product terms 
	assign p0 = ~i0 & ~i1; 
	assign pl = i0 & i1;

endmodule
