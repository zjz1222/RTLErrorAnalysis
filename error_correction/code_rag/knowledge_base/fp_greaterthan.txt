[Keyword]: fp_greaterthan

[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:  
The circuit is designed to compare two 13-bit floating-point numbers and determine if the first number is greater than the second number. The numbers are represented in a sign-magnitude format, where the most significant bit (MSB) is the sign bit.

[Input Signal Description]:  
- `first[12:0]`: A 13-bit input signal representing the first floating-point number. The MSB is the sign bit, and the remaining 12 bits represent the magnitude.
- `second[12:0]`: A 13-bit input signal representing the second floating-point number. The MSB is the sign bit, and the remaining 12 bits represent the magnitude.

[Output Signal Description]:  
- `gt`: A 1-bit output signal that is set to 1 if the first number is greater than the second number, otherwise it is set to 0.
