[Keyword]: Vector100r

[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
The circuit is designed to reverse the order of a 100-bit input vector. It takes a 100-bit input and outputs a 100-bit vector where the bits are in reverse order compared to the input.

[Input Signal Description]:
in[99:0]: A 100-bit input signal that represents the data to be reversed.

[Output Signal Description]:
out[99:0]: A 100-bit output signal that contains the reversed order of the input bits.

[Design Detail]: 
module top_module( 
    input [99:0] in,
    output [99:0] out
);

    always @(*) begin
        for(integer i = 0; i < 100; i++)
            out[i] = in[99 - i];
    end
