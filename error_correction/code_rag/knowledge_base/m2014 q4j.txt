[Design Category]: Arithmetic Circuits

[Design Function Description]:
This design implements a 4-bit binary adder. It takes two 4-bit binary numbers as inputs and produces a 5-bit sum as output. The additional bit in the output is used to accommodate any carry that results from the addition of the two 4-bit numbers.

[Input Signal Description]:
x[3:0]: A 4-bit input signal representing the first binary number to be added.
y[3:0]: A 4-bit input signal representing the second binary number to be added.

[Output Signal Description]:
sum[4:0]: A 5-bit output signal representing the sum of the two 4-bit input numbers. The least significant 4 bits represent the sum, and the most significant bit represents the carry-out from the addition.

[Design Detail]:

    input [3:0] x,
    input [3:0] y, 
    output [4:0] sum
);
    
    integer i;
    wire [3:0] cout;
    assign sum[0] = x[0] ^ y[0];
    assign cout[0] = x[0] & y[0];
    always @(*) begin
        for(i = 1; i < 4; i=i+1) begin
            sum[i] = x[i] ^ y[i] ^ cout[i-1];
            cout[i] = x[i] & y[i] | x[i] & cout[i-1] | y[i] & cout[i-1];
        end
        sum[4] = cout[3];
    end
