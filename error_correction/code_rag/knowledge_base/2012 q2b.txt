[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This circuit is a combinational logic circuit that processes a 6-bit input vector and a single-bit control signal to produce two specific outputs based on logical operations.

[Input Signal Description]:
y[5:0]: A 6-bit input vector that provides the data for logical operations.
w: A single-bit control signal that influences the logic applied to the input vector.

[Output Signal Description]:
Y1: The output is the result of a logical AND operation between the least significant bit of the input vector (y[0]) and the control signal (w).
Y3: The output is the result of a logical OR operation applied to several AND operations between specific bits of the input vector (y[1], y[2], y[4], y[5]) and the negation of the control signal (~w).

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule (
    input [5:0] y,
    input w,
    output Y1,
    output Y3
);

    assign Y1 = y[0]&w;
    assign Y3 = y[1]&(~w) | y[2]&(~w) | y[4]&(~w) | y[5]&(~w);
    
endmodule
