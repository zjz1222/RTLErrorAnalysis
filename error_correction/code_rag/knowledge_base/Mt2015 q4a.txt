[Design Category]: Combinational Logic

[Design Function Description]:
This circuit implements a simple combinational logic function that performs a bitwise XOR operation between two input signals, x and y, and then performs a bitwise AND operation with the result and the input signal x.

[Input Signal Description]:
x: A single-bit input signal.
y: A single-bit input signal.

[Output Signal Description]:
z: A single-bit output signal that results from the XOR operation between x and y, followed by an AND operation with x.

[Design Detail]: 
module topmodule (
  input x,
  input y,
  output z
);
   assign z = (x ^ y) & x;
endmodule
