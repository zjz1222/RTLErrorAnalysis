[Keyword]: led_dimmer

[Design Category]: Sequential Logic

[Design Function Description]:  
The circuit is a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) generator for dimming an LED. It uses a 4-bit resolution to control the duty cycle of the PWM signal, which is determined by the input `w`. The duty cycle is calculated as `w/16`, allowing for 16 different brightness levels.

[Input Signal Description]:  
- `clk`: Clock signal used to synchronize the operation of the circuit.
- `rst_n`: Active-low reset signal to initialize the circuit.
- `en`: Enable signal to activate the PWM generation.
- `w[3:0]`: 4-bit input that determines the duty cycle of the PWM signal. The value of `w` sets the proportion of the time the PWM signal is high during each cycle.

[Output Signal Description]:  
- `pwm`: The PWM output signal that controls the brightness of the LED. The duty cycle of this signal is determined by the input `w`.
